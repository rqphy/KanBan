# KanBan app

## 🚀 Main Idea
The main goal of this project is to practice NextJs and Typescript. Let’s create a kanban app to add some difficulty to the challenge. In the end, the user should be able to :

- create a task with a default or custom name
- add it to the day he wants
- move it to another day with a drag and drop method
